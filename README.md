# TwAPI
> a script for storing tweets from your Twitter friends into MongoDB

## Basic idea
If, for any reason, you need to archive and/or analyze what your friends (people you follow) are saying on Twitter, you can use this script to:

### 1. Get the ID's of your friends and store them to MongoDB

### 2. For each friend, get their tweets and store them to MongoDB

## TODO

1. Rate limit backoff functionality is very basic and has a built-in bug
2. Exclusion of users that have been fetched is very basic, needs refining
